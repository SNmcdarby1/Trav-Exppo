- Youtube tutorial
- Mapping used (Map Quest)[https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/tools/latitude-longitude-finder/]. To find aqccurate locations.
There were different tuturial that i watched in youtube. Below are a few that reall inspired byhthe style and design of the page.

6 Trouble shooting
 *  Decide to change the li element to lo because the ux appearance was not suitable to the and user friendly 6 Testing

 * While i was updating the git status i entered a git commit that change the changes that i had made . Resulted into doing a git reset command to using the SHA number f68f166.
 * The navigation bar is glitching the dropdown links are not visible in the mobile devise. I decided to change and delete the dropdown in the navigation bar and decided to add    a button that has etra pages. 
 * I encountered problems with the sidenav. Some of the content were not visible so i decided to change the design and use the navigation button that is displayed in w3school site.


7 Deployment.
I deployed the page in Github page under settings. Scroll down to the Github pages. Select the main-branch under the source. Once selected clickthe save button. A link will be enabled,once you receive the link you select it copy the link on your search engine. This will lead you to your public page. Ad that is how you deploy your repository to a public site.
